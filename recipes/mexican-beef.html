        <li> 1 tsp salt and pepper </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Beef</h3>
    <ul>
        <li> 1 - 2 tbsp olive oil </li>
        <li> 3 lb / 1.5kg beef chuck or brisket (or gravy or any other slow cooking beef) cut into 4 pieces </li>
        <li> 5 garlic cloves, minced </li>
        <li> 1 onion , diced (yellow, brown or white) </li>
        <li> 3/4 cup (185 ml) orange juice </li>
        <li> 2 tbsp lime juice</li>
        <li> 14 oz / 400g can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li> 2 cups (500 ml) beef or chicken broth/stock</li>
        <li>1/2 cup (125ml) water</li>
        <li> Salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3> Method</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine the Spice Mix ingredients in a bowl. Sprinkle 4 teaspoons over the beef and pat so it sticks.</li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large heavy based pot over high heat. Add the beef (in batches if necessary) and brown well on all sides. Remove onto a plate.</li>
        <li>Turn the stove down to medium. If the pot looks dry, add more olive oil. </li>
        <li>Add the garlic and onion and cook for 3 minutes until soft.</li>
        <li>Add the orange juice and lime juice, and scrape the bottom of the pot so the brown bits mix into the liquid. </li>
        <li>Add tomato, beef stock, water and remaining spice mix. Mix, then return beef into pot. </li>
        <li>Put the lid on, bring to a simmer then turn the stove down so it is bubbling gently, not rapidly. </li>
        <li>Cook for 2 hours, then remove lid and simmer for another 30 minutes until beef is tender enough to shred. (Note 2 other cook methods).</li>
        <li>Remove the beef from sauce, shred with 2 forks. </li>
        <li>Leave the sauce to simmer with the lid off for 10 to 15 minutes to reduce and thicken to your taste. Adjust salt to taste. </li>
        <li>Toss beef back into the sauce (can reserve some Sauce for drizzling on tacos if you want, there's plenty).</li>
        <li>Transfer beef into large dish and serve. See notes for suggestions.</li>
    </ol>
